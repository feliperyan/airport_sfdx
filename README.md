# Airport SFDX  App
Defines a custom object and custom Lightning App to help you showcase the data flowing from Kafka, into Postgres and then into the Lightning Platform through Heroku Connect.

The intention is to expand on this repo to include live data visualisations via Platform Events or direct websocket connections to Heroku Apps.

## Issues
As it is built at the moment, a lot of data is written to Salesforce via Heroku Connect. A developer org will run out of data storage space fairly quickly however a scratch org will endure much longer.
